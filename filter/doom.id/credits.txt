Unmaker sprites by Midway
Muzzle flash sprite by Potetobloke
Original DSLASER by Midway. Grabbed from Doom 64 Retribution (thanks Zik).
Gluon Gun Sounds by Valve Software
(constant laser attack's main inspiration from the gluon gun)
More firing sfx by Sorath, which came from Devil's Daggers, provided by a1337spy
Guidance System grabbed from Lambda
Beam stuff grabbed from Final Doomer (probably made by Yholl or Sgt. Shivers). shamelessly but unknown where it originally came from really.
timaeusTestified, Sgt. Major Kiwi, Yoguruto-no-Kami, and ZikShadow for assisting me, provide sprites and sounds, especially the first three who gave suggestions.
